#NFA Determinization and Minimization
This project presents a web-based page that offers an interactive and user-friendly interface to build an automaton and choose to determinize it (convert it 
to a DFA deterministic finite automaton) or determinize and minimize it (convert it to a minimal DFA).

##Development Details
The project was developed using GoJS and two technologies of the MeanJS stack: AngularJS and NodeJS. https://github.com/meanjs/mean
The front-end uses a combination of AngularJS and functions of the **FREE** evaluation version of GoJS, a licensed Javascript library that makes 
constructing JavaScript diagrams of complex nodes and links https://gojs.net/latest/index.html, and AngularJS.
The files are managed using npm,a Javascript package manager.
The back-end treatements are implemented using Javascript.

##Developers
This is a project made under the supervision of the Moroccan research professor Youssef Baddi during the academic year 2016-2017 
by: Sara Rachid, Yousra Mouho and Ayoub Ouissaden, software engineering students at the National School of Applied Science, ENSA,
